# Introduction

## What is the Cairo core library?

The Cairo core library provides the foundational building blocks for writing provable programs in Cairo. It offers essential utilities, data structures, mathematical functions, cryptographic tools, and system interactions making it suitable for both onchain and offchain development Whether you are working on Starknet smart contracts, cryptographic applications, or general-purpose Cairo programs, the core library provides the fundamental tools needed.

The core library is included in Cairo by default, meaning its features are available by simply importing specific modules into your program as follows:

```rust
use core::array::Array;

fn main() {
    let mut arr = Array::new();
    arr.append(42);
}
```

## How to use this documentation?

This documentation serves as a comprehensive reference for all components of the Cairo Core Library. It organizes functionality into modules, constants, functions, types, and traits, allowing developers to explore and understand available features efficiently. It is auto-generated from the core library's codebase using [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/extensions/documentation-generation.html), so if you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to improve the documentation, simply report an issue or submit a pull request on either [Cairo's](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) or [Scarb's](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb) GitHub repositories.

If you already know what you are looking for, the fastest way to find it is to use the search bar at the top of the page. Otherwise, you can take [a quick tour of the documentation](#a-quick-tour-of-the-documentation) and start clicking on anything the seems interesting. If this is your first time, we recommend starting with browsing the library's modules and experimenting with their functionality in your Cairo programs.

Happy coding! ð“…ƒ
